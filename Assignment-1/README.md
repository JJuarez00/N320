### Full-Stack Web Development...
<b>`involves building both`</b> the <ins>`Front-End`</ins> and <ins>`Back-End`</ins> of a web application. The Front-End works on what the user sees, which is the UI, and is built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript or Typescript. The Back-End is the brain of the web application. It handles the business logic, data flow, and communication with databases, APIs, and other external services, which is usually built with PHP, C++, Java, and so much more.

It's also used to build API's, Web servers, manage database interactions, and so much more.

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub
- <b>`Version Control`</b> is a system that tracks and manages changes to files. It keeps a history of edits/changes, allows for collaboration (see who did what), and helps compare, restore or undo changes to a file.
- <b>`Git`</b> is a version control system that is used by many developers (Over 70%, according to w3schools).
- <b>`GitHub`</b> is a platform that uses Git. It allows developers to share and store code, which makes it great for managing projects.
